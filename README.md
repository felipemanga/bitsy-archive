# This is a fork

This contains all the bitsy games from Ragzouken's [bitsy-archive](https://github.com/Ragzouken/bitsy-archive), but adapted for the [Pokitto](https://www.pokitto.com).

You can download the games one-by-one, or all of them bundled together [here](https://github.com/felipemanga/bitsy-archive/releases).

Tip: Don't put more than 50 bins on the SD card at a time.
Tip 2: You can zoom in/out using the C button.

# bitsy-archive
an archive (with permission) of bitsy gamedata

# bitsy boutique & inclusion in this archive
1. i probably already have you listed in my [Bitsy Omnibus](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eBUgCYOnMJ9REHuZdTodc6Ft2Vs6JXbH4K-bIgL9TPc/edit?usp=sharing), do i have the listed author credit correct or would you prefer something else?
2. could i have permission to include your games as part of the library when exhibiting my hardware bitsy player [Bitsy Boutique](https://candle.itch.io/bitsy-boutique)?
3. could i have permission to include your games' gamedata as part of this public archive of bitsy games?
